## Introduction

After attending React Day Berlin 2024, I was inspired to restart a project I wasn't at first sure how best to approach.
Once I attended the brilliant lecture by Tejas Kumar, on
[_React Server Components in AI Applications_](https://gitnation.com/contents/react-server-components-in-ai-applications){:target="\_blank"}, I was re-motivated to pick up where I left off and achieve my goals for this project.

## Motivation and Goals

Being a bit of a fitness fanatic, I've used more than my fare share of workout planning and diet tracking apps. After using [MacroFactor](https://macrofactorapp.com/) (would highly recommend), I was fascinated by their **_AI Describe Feature_**.
